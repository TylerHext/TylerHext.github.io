<a name="introduction"></a>

I set out to build a handwired keyboard to learn soldering, basic circuitry and programming microcontrollers. Along the way I discovered how deep the community of keyboard enthusiasts and artisans is. While I barely scratched the surface, I've recorded the process for my own reference and hope it's helpful for anyone looking to do something similar.

## Background <a name="background"></a>

Before attempting this project I had no experience with soldering or circuitry in general, no knowledge of how keyboards work, and some experience programming in Python. I decided to build a keyboard because I was looking for a project where I could learn to program microcontrollers and solder electrical components. I use a keyboard everyday and wanted the fun of using a tool I programmed myself. 

I spent a lot of time reading [tutorials](#resources) to compliment my lack of knowledge and they are the primary reason this keyboard actually works.

## Tools and Components <a name="tools-components"></a>

| Item           | Quantity | Cost USD |
| -------------- | :------: | -------: |
| [Switches](#switches)       |    88    |    $22  |
| [Springs](#springs)        |    88    |    $10  |
| [Keycaps](#keycaps)        |    88    |    $40  |
| [Diodes](#diodes)         |    88    |     $6  |
| [Stabilizers](#stabilizers)    |     6    |     $7  |
| [Controller](#controller)     |     1    |    $13  |
| [Lubricant](#lubricant)      |     1    |    $11  |
| [Plate](#plate)          |     1    |    $14  |
| [Soldering Iron](#soldering-iron) |     1    |    $24  |
| [Solder](#solder)         |     1    |     $9  |
| [Wire](#wire)           |     1    |     $6  |
| [Wire stripper](#wire-stripper)  |     1    |     $7  |
|      **Total**        |          |   **$159**   |

The total is a bit more than I planned to spend but overall not too bad. Ignoring tools/wire/solder which can be used for more projects and springs/lubricant which is optional, you can get the price-per-board down to ~$90.

You can get a solid keyboard from a vendor for like ~$100 so if your goal is to get a nice keyboard for an affordable price it probably doesn't make the most sense to handwire your own board. If your goal is to learn circuitry this was a really fun project for a good price and I definitely recommend it.
